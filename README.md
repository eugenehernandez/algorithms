# Algorithms

This repository serves as a personal collection of notes, documentation, and references for various Data Structure Algorithms that I have encountered in academic settings, work, job applications, and more. The goal is to maintain a well-organized and easily accessible reference to refresh my memory on algorithms and their applications.

## Purpose

- **Documentation & Notes**: Keep track of key algorithms, their explanations, and common use cases.
- **Quick Reference**: Easily reference algorithms that may be needed for academic, work, or job-related tasks.
- **Learning**: Consolidate knowledge and improve understanding by documenting and explaining algorithms in my own words.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hashmaps, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, etc.
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Understanding the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity.

Most of the algorithms and their explanations can be found in more detail on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org), which is an excellent resource for algorithmic learning.

## Structure

- **`/docs`**: Documentation files and explanations of individual algorithms.
- **`/src`**: Code implementations for each algorithm.
- **`/tests`**: Test cases for verifying the correctness of algorithms.
  
Each algorithm is categorized under its respective data structure or type and includes explanations, sample code, and time complexity analysis.
